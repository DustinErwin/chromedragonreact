## Description

This is a gym tracker app which allows clients to create accounts, log in with existing accounts, see trainer information, view and join classes, and shop the Dev Fit store. It also allows trainers to add or remove their own classes. Managers on this app are able to view a list of trainers employed by the gym, pull up an individual trainer's information, terminate a trainer's employment by removing that trainer from the database, or hire a new trainer by adding his/her information into the database. A manager can also view all classes available at the gym for the week, view class rosters, and add/remove members from class rosters.
